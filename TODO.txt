# URGENT - before next release

## Clear buttons on stats/plot/phot should be changed to a hide/show button that updates as needed

Also, set_new_slice plot needs to somehow turn on/off plot line 

## refactor ztv_api to get rid of the number of send_to_stream(self._subproc.stdin....

## add z.methods to fits faker example that starts/stops faker





## review for critical additional commands to ztv_api and implement

- move all autoload functionality to source_panel
- clean up autoload mode chagnes to be just with publish/subscribe signals - may need to think abotu some better programmatic way of signaling to sub-objects of ztv_frame... (in same way as did "get_..." )

## migrate README.rst to markdown

## add screenshots to README.rst

## update Manual.txt

including migration to *.md

### confirm latest up to github

## write-up/clean-up notes on how to package/test/release in NOTES.txt



# For some future release

## clean up how auto-load mode is turned on/off, e.g. in CommandListenerThread is messy

## ztv_api needs way to get back current filename (can load via load, but to get current status, in same way as can for sky/flat)

## implement & document additional commands to ztv_api

- set:  min_value_mode_on_new_image/max_value_mode_on_new_image - need to think through how to do this 'nicely' in a discoverable manner.

## look into moving build/dist workflows to 'wheels', [here](https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/distributing.html#id55)

## load from an hdulist (i.e. if you already read in the fits file in your python command line, or downloaded from somewhere and don't want to write to disk)

## for aperture photometry, give ra/dec of center & a scale of arcsec on the radial plot (if ra/dec available)

## figure out how to deal with image_radec in load_fits_file for 3-d case

need some real-world test cases of what we might be dealing with

## need to dig up more examples of multi-d fits files that we might be dealing with feeding in to 3-d

## in source panel offer option to access N most recent images (I think in source panel, and not overall 3-d image number controller)

## figure out how I want to visually distinguish in GUI between editable and non-editable (but copy-able) text fields

## [Harvest ideas from this blog post on setup.py tricks](http://www.pydanny.com/python-dot-py-tricks.html)

## add ActiveMQ example into fits_faker_panel.py

## think through what info should ztv pull from activemq msg to then display in self.SetTitle of main frame?

## in stats panel, should be able to enter just numbers (without first clicking/dragging a stats box) and it activates once enough info is specified

## in stats panel, each editing of range step should make sense by itself.  not dependent on prior history.  e.g. xlow=1, xlow=3432, xlow=1

right now it's screwed up, esp. if you're reversing low/high.

## To stats panel:  add ability to choose "recent" selection areas (e.g. switch back and forth between some different areas)

## careful examination of slice plots and whether limits and exact paths across pixels are correct

## add keyboard shortcuts to line/column plots (x/l and y/c) in plot mode

Probably build this in to ztv.py and send new_slice_plot_xy[0/1] messages.  But, need to figure out how to get current matplotlib cursor coordinates when it's not a mouse event...

## control panel for drawing/managing shapes (lines, boxes, circles)

## re-visit colors of overplotted things, e.g. slice plot and stats box etc

want sensible, don't want garish  (some way to link to the panels?  background colors? underlining of titles on tabs?)

## ability to do masked numpy arrays with different color value for masked positions

## fix bug: problem when auto-loading fits files that typing into curfile/curdir fields is pain in the butt as cursor keep smoving.  think it's an issue in "on_fitsfile_loaded"???

## Fix error/warning messages: "deviceDeltaX" [Y] is deprecated, & continuousScroll is deprecated

e.g.:

    In [60]: 2015-03-24 08:57:59.055 Python[8660:1232061] -_continuousScroll is deprecated for NSScrollWheel. Please use -hasPreciseScrollingDeltas.
    2015-03-24 08:57:59.055 Python[8660:1232061] -deviceDeltaX is deprecated for NSScrollWheel. Please use -scrollingDeltaX.
    2015-03-24 08:57:59.055 Python[8660:1232061] -deviceDeltaY is deprecated for NSScrollWheel. Please use -scrollingDeltaY.

## think through generic pass through of parameters for typical `z = ztv.ZTV()` launching

add to:
    class ZTVMain()  # in ztv.py
    class ZTV.__init__()   #  in ztv_api.py
    
Is probably straightforward for simple things like minval, or even string filenames to load a fits file.  But, gets complicated quickly if passing numpy arrays for display.  Will need to think about how to do.  Or, whether to just do limited subset.  

Another issue is visibility - how to make it clear to user what one can do?  That's an argument for the extra complexity (and less flexibility) of just manually specifiying what can be passed through.

## re-consider which color maps to include

[based on:](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/10/16/how-bad-is-your-colormap/)

## in min/max control, consider an additional mode_on_new_image of N-sigma above(below) median

## in source panel '/User/hroe/' (not a filename) shouldn't appear in the history popup menu

## in stats panel:  tabbing through textctrl's doesn't loop around at the end

## Allow enabling/disabling of components of SourcePanel at startup

- allow enable/disable of ActiveMQ in SourcePanel at startup (default = off?) 
- Allow enable/disable of Auto-load file in SourcePanel at startup (default = on?) 

## in source panel, with hiding/showing GUI elements, ideally should have everything dynamically re-arrange.  This probably requires deleting/adding the elements, not just hiding/showing

## To color control panel:  add a histogram panel with click-and-drag min/max markers

## To stats panel:  add ability to switch between circle (ellipse?) and box.  

need to think through how circle defined - click cneter and drag out?  Confined within click-drag box (works better for ellipses?)

## crisper 'historgram' style plotting for slice plots when really zoomed in

## run through a syntax checker and cleanup most/all objections (e.g. "x*y" vs. "x * y")

## in source panel fields:  tab to complete doesn't work at first attempt in fields after clicking.  have to type a character first.  After that behavior is correct.  (launch ztv; click in a field, hit tab.  nothing.  type a character (even not matching), delete it, hit tab -> works)

## is error checking behavior of Source Panel->Current FITS file correct?  seems to error check only upon Return key.  Not actively as you type.  Meanwhile the auto-load file fields work correctly, updating color clues in real time.

## Source Panel->Autoload-file:  auto-redistribute filename vs. directory to Dir/Filename (is there some use case where you don't want to 'correct' the user?)

## Tab to complete in Source Panel->Current FITS file is not working currently (is in auto-load file fields)

## Tab to complete in Source panel fields:  shift-Tab should step back (in case you went past completion you wanted)

## consider:  what color should be used for blank/fill space in ImagePanels?  (currently white, but should it be black? adjustable?)

## design & implement global keyboard shortcuts, e.g. cmd-o for opening a file, what else??

## access catalogs (local & internet) and overplot

## Consider re-vamping method of monitoring for new/changed FITS files on disk

[e.g. see](https://github.com/joh/when-changed)

## consider in phot panel radial plot:  click-and-drag to adjust aprad and skyrad in/out??

## fix that ctrl-c in ipython is killing ztv gui, even when run via a separate process with ztv_api

Problem:

    import ztv
    z = ztv.ZTV()
    # now do some other things
    # and hit ctrl-c
    # kills the subprocess'd ztv gui
    
I think fix will be around the `ztv_api.py` line that launches ztv with: `subprocess.Popen`.

## Make ztv fully python 3 compatible

## Upon ztv.close() (or cmd-Q or any of the other ways of closing a ztv window) the process doesn't terminate cleanly (v. low priority)

e.g.
    import ztv
    z = ztv.ZTV()
    z.close()  # leaves a process dangling, but not using hardly any resources.
               # AND, it goes away the moment you reassign z as python does it's cleanup properly.

This isn't much of an issue, even if relaunching ztv a bunch of times, b/c usually you'd be doing that into the same name & therefore the earlier processes would get cleaned up on their own.

this mean that ZTVFrame.ztvframe_pid as a signaling device isn't working.  the ztvframe_pid is grabbed correctly, but the PID isn't actually fully killed until the overall python session is killed.  (something changes with the process when the window is closed, but it's not actually cleaned up fully/correctly.)  This is an issue both for processes that may be watching (e.g. fits_fake_panel.py), but also that if you launch a ton of ztv sessions from same python session under different names, you are leaving cruft around that may eventually slow things down.

## clean-up/regularize all documentation files, probably all should be formatted with Markdown?

## create some way of saving/restoring settings?

## add some way of producing publication-quality output, esp. producing python scripts to recreate figures?
