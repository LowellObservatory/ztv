# URGENT - before next release

## Work through lots of example fits file inputs and make reading more robust, e.g. barfing on nirspec and pharo data currently



# Desirable before next release

## re-consider which color maps to include

[based on:](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/10/16/how-bad-is-your-colormap/)



# Medium high-priority for some future release:

## ability to do masked numpy arrays with different color value for masked positions


## Make which control panels are loaded optional, including a 'default' group.

See ztv.ControlPanels class.


## Allow enabling/disabling of components of SourcePanel at startup

- allow enable/disable of ActiveMQ in SourcePanel at startup (default = off?) 
- Allow enable/disable of Auto-load file in SourcePanel at startup (default = on?) 


# Low priority for some future release:

## consider:  what color should be used for blank/fill space in ImagePanels?  (currently white, but should it be black? adjustable?)

## design & implement global keyboard shortcuts, e.g. cmd-o for opening a file

## fix that ctrl-c in ipython is killing ztv gui, even when run via a separate process with ztv_api

Problem:

    import ztv
    z = ztv.ZTV()
    # now do some other things
    # and hit ctrl-c
    # kills the subprocess'd ztv gui
    
I think fix will be around the `ztv_api.py` line that launches ztv with: `subprocess.Popen`.
