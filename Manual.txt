As of v0.1.0, this manual is not being distributed as it still needs a good bit of work and most everything essential is described in README.md and/or pretty discoverable.

# ztv - intro

This document will form the basis for a manual for `ztv` at some point in the future.  At this time it should be more viewed as a description of features, useful for testing that the intended functionality is working.

# Global keyboard short cuts

- cmd Q - close & quit ztv instance
- cmd W - close & quit ztv instance
- cmd [/] - navigate tabbed panels

# Image display panels:

- all should use same color conversion (scaling, color map, limits, etc) & update automatically/simultaneously

## `PrimaryImagePanel` - the main image display

- current cursor position:
    - shown in status bar at bottom of ztv window
    - keep center of LoupeImagePanel updated
- Left click (depends on cursor mode)
- Right click -> popup menu
    - select cursor mode (also selectable with cmd-# of menu item)
        - None -> left click does nothing
        - Zoom 
            - click-and-drag -> draw box to zoom to upon release
            - double-click -> zoom out by 2x centered on click
        - Pan 
            - click -> re-center to click
            - double-click (acts as 2 clicks; TODO: consider should double-click re-center?)
        - Stats box
            - click-and-drag -> draw box & calculate basic statistics inside that box
            - when selected auto-changes the notebook page to the stats page, although user can then switch away
        - Phot
            - do aperture photometry at clicked point
            - when selected auto-changes the notebook page to the phot page, although user can then switch away
    - select color map from list
    - invert color map
    - set color map scaling
    - Display FITS header (if available)

## `OverviewImagePanel` - small panel that shows full extent of image

- Shows full image, filling with blank space on sides or top/bottom in order to respect aspect ratio of image
- Shows a box of the currently visible region in `PrimaryImagePanel`, updates in real-time
- (any) click-and-drag within box -> moves visible region around in `PrimaryImagePanel`
- (any) double-click -> reset zoom-and-center of `PrimaryImagePanel` to display full extent of image

## `LoupeImagePanel` - small panel shows zoom of area under cursor within `PrimaryImagePanel`

- no interaction, just updates automatically to show zoomed region around cursor, if cursor is within `PrimaryImagePanel`


# Control panels 

These are grouped into a Notebook.

## Source panel

Current FITS File:
- Text field can type directly into
    - has error checking (turns pink background if doesn't exist, green if exists & not loaded, white if loaded)
    - tab to complete (tab to cycle through completions, looping through options; shift-Tab to go backwards)
    - has dropdown recents menu
    - has OS file picker button (ellipsis)
- Show header button (greyed out if not fits file loaded)

Auto-load file:
- Directory to search:
    - has error checking (turns pink background if doesn't exist, green if exists & not loaded, white if loaded)
    - tab to complete (tab to cycle through completions, looping through options; shift-Tab to go backwards)
    - has dropdown recents menu
    - has OS file picker button (ellipsis)

ActiveMQ:
TK

## Photometry (Phot):

TK

## Statistics (Stats):

For currently selected stats box (all should be selectable for copying)
- x-range, y-range, x-size, y-size  (all adjustable)
- N-pixels
- min-value and location(s)
- max-value and location(s)
- Mean, median, stdev
- robust mean, robust stdev

## Plot

TK

Vertical slice at current cursor position in Primary Image Panel is activated with a keypress of one of ['c', 'C', 'v', 'V', 'y', 'Y'].   Similarly, a horizontal slice is activated with a keypress of one of ['r', 'R', 'h', 'H', 'x', 'X'].  If a 3-d image stack is loaded, then one of ['z', 'Z'] will activate a plot through the stack at the currently selected pixel.

## Color:

Min/Max control:
- Text field for each
    - background: white if current, green if OK but need to press Return, pink if error (typically not a number)
    - if max<min, then invert numbers and change inversion
- Buttons:
    - Auto (set min/max to automatically determined values)
    - Min, Max, Min/Max.  Set min to min, max to max, or both min/min and max/max
- Dropdown menus for what to do when a new image is loaded.
    - one menu for Min, one for Max, one that controls both (and will update both individual menus)
    - choices are: Min/Max, Auto, Constant  (or for the middle 'both' menu: -, in the case that Min/Max choices are not identical)
Color Control:
- Dropdown menu to select color map
- inverted checkbox
- Scaling:
    - Linear
    - Log
